In this repository, I will show you how to build a neural network from scratch (yes, by using plain python code with no framework involved) that trains by mini-batches using gradient descent. Check **nn.py** for the code.

In this realated notebook **Neural_Network_from_scratch_with_Numpy.ipynb** we will test nn.py: for a set of non-linear classification problems

- We'll train the neural network for some number of epochs and some hyperparameters
- Plot a live/interactive decision boundary 
- Plot the train and validation metrics such as the loss and the accuracies


# Example: Noisy Moons 

![Decision boundary]()
